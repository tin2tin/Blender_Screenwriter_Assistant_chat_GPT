## Write

Write got two entry boxes. Since this chatGPT solution do not have any memory, you can use the first text box for the assignment you want solved right now ex. write a scene where this happens. The secound text box are for the elements which are general for the story like a plot outline and characte descriptions. Having it devided into two text boxes means you can clean the first box to quickly enter the current assignment, but keep the general stuff.

## Rewrite

Rewrite is for changing the selection according to the prompt. Ex.
- "Translate to English"
- "Improve the grammar"
- "Fix spelling miskakes"
- "Insert camera angels and shot descriptions this way [[shot: description]]"
